# Commerce TurtleCoin
[<img src="https://badge.turtlepay.io/">](https://turtlepay.io)

Payment Gateway for Drupal Commerce to allow payments with 
[TurtleCoin](https://turtlecoin.lol).

**Work in progress. Under active development.**

Issue Handling is done on Drupal.org: 
[Drupal Project Page](https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/daveiano/3029539)

## What this Modules does

Commerce TurtleCoin is providing two (currently one, second is in development) 
Payment Gateways for paying with [TurtleCoin](https://turtlecoin.lol) in 
[Drupal Commerce](https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce). 

The first is an implementation with the 
[Wallet RPC API](https://api-docs.turtlecoin.lol/?php#wallet-rpc-api)
to generate an integrated address on checkout and track the transaction
to void it after a given time or complete it if the payment arrives.

The second payment gateway uses [TurtlePayâ„¢](https://turtlepay.io/) 
to process the payment.

Included is also a submodule <code>Commerce TurtleCoin Currency on Checkout</code>, which uses <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce_currency_resolver">Commerce Currency Resolver</a> to change the order currency on checkout to TRTL if a Turtle Payment Gateway is used.

You can enter the product prices in Euro or Dollar, an Exchange rate service for Commerce Currency Resolver is included which uses the <a href="https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/">CryptoCompare API</a> to calculate the TRTL price if necessary.

## Installation

The gateway implemented with Wallet RPC API needs a running and connected
TurtleCoind and turtle-service service.

See here: 
[https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin)

For installation and setting up a wallet see here: 
[https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/wiki/Using-zedwallet](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/wiki/Using-zedwallet)

The instructions from the 
<a href="https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin-woocommerce-gateway#set-up-turtlecoin-daemon-and-turtle-service">
turtlecoin-woocommerce-gateway</a> are also very useful 
([Link](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin-woocommerce-gateway#set-up-turtlecoin-daemon-and-turtle-service)):

<blockquote>After downloading (or compiling) the TurtleCoin binaries on your 
server, run <code>TurtleCoind</code> and <code>turtle-service</code>. 
You can skip running <code>TurtleCoind</code> by using a remote node 
with <code>turtle-service</code> by adding <code>--daemon-address</code> 
and the address of a public node.  


Note on security: using this option, while the most secure, requires you to run 
the Turtle-Service program on your server. Best practice for this is to use a 
view-only wallet since otherwise your server would be running a hot-wallet and 
a security breach could allow hackers to empty your funds.</blockquote>


This module includes two very basic config files you could use for the
two services as a basis. You can use them via

`./TurtleCoind -c path/to/config/TurtleCoind-config.json`

and 

`./turtle-service -c path/to/config/turtle-service-config.json`. 

**Warning:** Change the passwords for production.
